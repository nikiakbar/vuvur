## 2026-04-05 - Improper Decorator Placement Bypassing Auth
**Vulnerability:** Security decorators (like `@api_key_required`) were being bypassed because they were placed *above* the Flask `@app.route` decorator.
**Learning:** Flask's `@app.route` registers the view function at the time it's called. If a security decorator is placed above it, the route is registered with the *original* function before the decorator has a chance to wrap it with security checks.
**Prevention:** Always place security, authentication, and authorization decorators *below* the `@app.route` (or `@bp.route`) decorator to ensure the wrapped function is what gets registered with the router.

## 2026-04-05 - Timing Attack Vulnerability in API Key Comparison
**Vulnerability:** API keys were compared using standard equality (`==`), which is susceptible to timing attacks.
**Learning:** Standard string comparison returns as soon as a mismatch is found, allowing an attacker to brute-force a key by measuring how long the server takes to respond.
**Prevention:** Use `secrets.compare_digest()` for constant-time comparison of secrets and API keys.

## 2026-04-19 - Information Leakage via Raw Exception Strings
**Vulnerability:** API endpoints were returning raw exception messages (`str(e)`) to the client, exposing internal implementation details.
**Learning:** Using `str(e)` in a production API response is a shortcut that often leaks sensitive information about the environment, database schema, or code structure.
**Prevention:** Always catch exceptions, log the detailed error server-side (using `logger.error(..., exc_info=True)`), and return a generic, non-descriptive error message to the client.

## 2026-05-22 - Mitigation of Timing-Based Username Enumeration
**Vulnerability:** The login process was susceptible to username enumeration via timing attacks because it returned early when a username was not found, skipping the expensive password hashing step.
**Learning:** Argon2 is intentionally slow to prevent brute-force attacks. However, if this delay only occurs for existing users, it creates a side-channel that leaks whether a username exists in the system.
**Prevention:** Always perform a password verification using a pre-computed dummy hash when the username is not found. This ensures that the response time remains consistent regardless of whether the user exists, provided the dummy hash has the same computational cost as a real one.
